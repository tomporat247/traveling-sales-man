# traveling-sales-man

traveling-sales-man is a web app developed in react with Leaflet.

It is used as a demo presented in the end of my lecture on genetic algorithms.

The traveling-sales-man app demonstrates the capabilities of generic algorithms and allows altering the results by tweaking the algorithm's parameters.


## Disclosure

The genetic algorithm in this client's code only exists in here for the sake of simplicity and for displaying the algorithms state and results in real time.

Production apps shouldn't run this kind of operations on the client side.
